## 🎨 Design Philosophy

<div align="center">

```css
/* Color Palette */
:root {
  --primary-blue: #0B1426;
  --accent-cyan: #00D9FF;
  --text-light: #E2E8F0;
  --surface-dark: #1A202C;
  --gradient: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);
}
```

</div>

The design follows modern cybersecurity aesthetics with:
- **Clean minimalist layout** for professional appearance
- **Cybersecurity color scheme** (dark blues, cyans, matrix greens)
- **Smooth animations** for enhanced user experience
- **Mobile-first approach** ensuring accessibility across devices
